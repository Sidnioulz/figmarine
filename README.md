### Getting Started

This project uses PNPM as a package manager, and Turbo as a monorepo provider.

- See the [installation instructions for PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- Clone the whole repository; all published projects depend on internal utility and config packages
- Run `pnpm i` at the root of the monorepo to have everything installed
- You can now switch to the package you're interested in working on and check its `README.md`
